## UFC Striking versus Grappling

An analysis of MMA fights 2010 to 2021. The data set was provided by [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mdabbert/ultimate-ufc-dataset?select=most-recent-event.csv).

This was my last case study of Careerfoundry course which focused on the following new skills:
* Sourcing open data
* Geospatial analysis and visualizations
* Supervised machine learning: Regression
* Unsupervised machine learning: Clustering
* Sourcing and analyzing Time Series data

The analysis explores two hypetheses:
1. Taller MMA fighters have a longer reach
2. Grappling arts have surpassed the arts of striking
